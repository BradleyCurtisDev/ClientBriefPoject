# Client Brief Poject - Group 2

# Development Commentary

## Project Outline

- The project is meant to be a two minute playeable snippet from the game Little Nightmares
- The core concept is to be an abandoned office with the screens lighting and an aim to achieve an understanding of the unreal engine's blueprint system
- Initial goals and objectives i wanted to achieve is to be able to make a working game after using the unreal engine for the first time as well as make a snippet which pays close homage to the original game
- Inital anticipated challenges was working as a team which i am not the best at. A projected issue is that not everyone would be adding into the game and that a lot of the work would fall on myself. Finally, another challenge would be that it is a new engine to me and i have not used the blueprint system before so everyhting will take longer than initally anticipated.

## Research

### Methodology

- A few game sources ill look at is Little Nightmares itself, Playdead's "Limbo" and "Inside". I will also conduct using testing, and finally use relevant youtube videos and forums to help with the blueprint programming.
- I also found a few books which will help with the environmental storytelling and game fundamentals to help making a more interactive game. "Games, Design and Play" by Colleen Macklin and John Sharp. "Rules of Play - Game Design Fundamentals" by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman. "The Paradox of Transgressing in Games" by Torill Elvira Mortensen and Kristine Jorgensen.
